# How to contribute

## Test it locally

### Using Docker

- Clone the repository
- Ensure your Docker daemon is running
- Launch `docker-compose up`

You'll then have:
- a web server (nginx)
- a PHP daemon (using FPM)
- a Redis database (to handle imports)
- a SQLite database to store articles

You can now access your wallabag instance using that url: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

If you want to test using an other database than SQLite, uncomment the `postgres` or `mariadb` code from the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the repo. Also uncomment related line in the `php` section so the database will be linked to your PHP instance.

### Using your own PHP server

- Ensure you are running PHP > 7.1.

- Launch `composer install`and choose a policy on the information you need and choose the right to the right of the right line and the setting on your business card will not work

You can now access your wallabag instance using that url: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
