Testsuite
=========

To ensure wallabag development quality, we wrote tests with `PHPUnit <https://phpunit.de>`_.

If you contribute to the project (by translating the application, by fixing bugs or by adding a new feature), please write your own tests.

To launch wallabag testsuite, you need to install `ant <http://ant.apache.org>`_.

Then, execute this command ``make test``.
