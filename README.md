## Usage
You can easily add a "poched" page with the bookmarklet.

poche save the entire content of a poched links : text and pictures are stored on your server.

You can :
* read a page in a comfortable reading view
* archive a link
* put a link in favorite
* delete a link

## Requirements & installation
You have to install [sqlite for php](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite.php) on your server.

Get the [latest version](https://github.com/inthepoche/poche) of poche on github. Unzip it and upload it on your server. poche must have write access on assets, cache and db directories.

The ./public directory contains files that must be exported through your web server, and
then placed in the /ad hoc/ directory.

That's all, **poche works** !
